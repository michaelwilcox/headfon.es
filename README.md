# What is this?

This is an app that leverages the Spotify API for listening to music.
It has basic search functionality for albums, songs, playlists.
It's built on React, TypeScript, GraphQL and NodeJS.

# Setup

## Requirements

- [Node <= 14.17.5](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

**NOTE**

Currently this only supports up to Node v14.
I need to move away from [node-sass-chokidar](https://github.com/michaelwayman/node-sass-chokidar)
as it is now deprecated. This project is still using `node-sass` ~v4 and this does not support node > v14.

### Steps

0. [add environment variables](#environment-variables)
1. `mongod`
2. `yarn run install-deps`
3. `yarn run start-dev`

This will install everything and open the app in browser.
If something is broken, [please file an issue](https://github.com/michaelwilcox/headfon.es/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md) so I can fix!
Want to make this setup as painless as possible.

# Environment Variables

these can live in an `.env` file under `/server`

```bash
DEBUG=false

PROD_HOST=http://localhost
DEV_HOST=http://localhost
PROD_PORT=3000
DEV_PORT=3004
SESSION_SECRET=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
